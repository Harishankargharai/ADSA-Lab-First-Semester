Execution Time Simulator : Uses each functionâ€™s value as the basis for a dummy loop to simulate computational effort.
                           Measures the actual execution time for increasing n
Function Growth Plotter (C + Gnuplot) : Plots them using gnuplot for a visual comparison
                                        Helps in understanding how functions increase relative to each other as n grows.

The plot program helps us visualize growth trends, while the timing program shows how these
trends translate into real computational cost. 
Used together, they provide both theoretical and experimental insight into complexity analysis.
